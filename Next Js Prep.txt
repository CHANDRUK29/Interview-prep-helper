1. What is Next.js?
    Next.js is an open-source web development React-based framework created by Vercel, which is famous for its
    unique features such as Server-side rendering and enhanced SEO. It has some additional features such as
    data fetching utilities, dynamic API routes, optimized builds, etc. It is a framework built upon React, Webpack, and Babel.

2. How Next is different from other JavaScript frameworks?
    Next.js is a JavaScript framework that is primarily designed for building React applications. 
    Here are some key ways in which Next.js differs from other JavaScript frameworks:

    *)Server-Side Rendering (SSR): One of the significant distinctions of Next.js is its built-in support for server-side rendering. 
        This allows pages to be rendered on the server rather than the client, providing benefits like improved SEO and faster initial page loads.
    *)Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits the JavaScript code into smaller chunks, allowing for efficient loading of only the
        necessary code for a particular page.
    *)API Routes: Next.js makes it easy to create API routes within the same project, simplifying the development of backend functionality alongside the frontend.
    *)Built-in Image Optimization: The next/image component provides built-in support for image optimization, handling tasks like lazy loading 
        and responsive images without the need for additional configuration.
    *)Easy Deployment: Next.js simplifies the deployment process with various options, including static site hosting, serverless deployment, and more. 
        This ease of deployment is not always as straightforward in other frameworks.
    

3) Mention some features of Next.js.
    *)Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js allows server-side rendering, improving initial page load performance by rendering HTML 
        on the server and sending it to the client.
    *)Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js supports static site generation, enabling the pre-rendering of pages at build time, 
        resulting in faster loading times and  better SEO.
    *)File System-Based Routing: The routing system is based on the file structure of the "pages" directory, making it intuitive 
        and easy to organize code.
    *)Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits code into smaller chunks, loading only what's necessary for each page. 
        This enhances performance by reducing initial bundle sizes.
    *)API Routes: Easily create serverless functions by defining API routes alongside your pages, simplifying the development 
        of server-side logic.


4) List some common performance optimization techniques in Next.js.
        *)Use static generation (SSG) for pages that can be pre-rendered.
        *)Implement incremental static regeneration (ISR) for dynamic content.
        *)Use the next/image component for optimized images.
        *)Enable code splitting and tree shaking.
        *)Use dynamic imports for large components.
        *)Optimize CSS with CSS modules or styled-components.
        *)Leverage caching strategies for API routes.


5) Mention some common security practices in Next.js.
        *)Use HTTPS for secure communication.
        *)Implement authentication and authorization.
        *)Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.
        *)Use environment variables for sensitive data.
        *)Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
        *)Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
        *)Use secure cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags.


6) what is Server Side Rendering (SSR)?
        Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js is a technique where pages are pre-rendered
        into complete HTML on the server for each request and sent it to browser for displaying.


7) What is Static Site Generation in NextJs?
        Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js is a rendering method where web pages are 
        pre-rendered into static HTML files at build time, rather than on each user request


8) what is Incremental Static Regeneration?
        Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) is a Next.js rendering strategy that enables you
        to update static pages after the site has been built and deployed, without needing a 
        full rebuild of the entire application


9) Explain the concept of dynamic routing in Next.js:
        Dynamic routing in Next.js allows developers to create routes with dynamic parameters, 
        enabling pages to handle different data or content based on these parameters.


10)  What is meant by Styled JSX in Next.js?
        Styled JSX is a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write encapsulated and scoped CSS to style
        your components.


11) How do you pass data between pages in a Next.js application?
        There are multiple ways to pass data between pages:
            URL Query Parameters: Send data through the URL and access it via the useRouter hook.
            Router API: Use Next.js routing to programmatically navigate and pass state.
            State Management Libraries: Use tools like Redux or React Context to share data across pages.
            Server-Side Data Fetching: Use getServerSideProps to fetch data on the server and pass it as props
                to the page component.


12) What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in Next.js, and how does it improve the development experience?
        Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in Next.js that updates modules in a running application
        without requiring a full page reload
