1) What are Micro FrontEnd?
      Micro frontends (MFEs) is a web development architecture where a large frontend application is broken down into smaller,
      independent, and deployable modules, each responsible for a specific business feature, allowing different teams to build,
      test, and deploy them autonomously, often using different technologies, mirroring the microservices approach for the backend
      PROS:
            Teams release features without waiting on others
            Different frameworks or versions can coexist
            Teams can work in parallel with fewer conflicts
      CONS:
            Multiple JS bundles
            Duplicate dependencies (React, lodash)
            Slower initial load if not optimized
            State management is hard
            Multiple repos & Multiple CI/CD pipelines


2) What Is Webpack Module Federation?
      Webpack Module Federation (introduced in Webpack 5) allows multiple independent JavaScript applications to share code at runtime.
      With Module Federation (the new world):
            *)Apps are independent
            *)They talk to each other at runtime
            *)Shared dependencies (like React) are not duplicated
            *)Each app can be deployed on its own
      Core Concepts of Webpack module Federation:
            *)Host: The application currently running in the browser that consumes modules from another application.
            *)Remote: A separate application that exposes modules (components, functions, etc.) for the Host to consume.
            *)Exposed Module: A specific file or component made available by a Remote to be used by other applications.
            *)Shared Module: A dependency (like React or Vue) that is shared across applications to avoid code duplication.
            *)Runtime: Code is loaded while the application is running in the user's browser, not during the build process. 

      Pros of Module Federation:
            Independent deployments - Update one app without rebuilding others
            Runtime code sharing - No npm publishing required
            Smaller bundles - Shared libraries loaded once

      Cons of Module Federation:
            Runtime failures - Remote down = feature broken
            Version conflicts - Bad shared config = subtle bugs

2) B) When Microfrontend Apps Crash ?
            *)The remote becomes down,slow, deployed incorrectly or blocked by CDN/Network
                  Solution:
                        Error boundaries
                        Fallback UI
                        Health checks
            *) Version mismatch in shared dependencies
            *) Bad Module Federation configuration - Wrong exposed path,Remote name mismatch,Incorrect URL
            *) Sharing state or globals incorrectly
            *) CSS & DOM collisions - Global CSS leaks,Reset styles override other apps.


3) What is Redux Toolkit Query(RTK)?
            RTK Query (Redux Toolkit Query) is a powerful data fetching and caching solution built into the official Redux 
            Toolkit (RTK) package. It is designed to simplify common data loading scenarios in web applications, 
            eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching and caching logic yourself. 


4) What is concurrent Rendering?
            Concurrent rendering in React is a foundational update introduced in React 18 that allows React to interrupt a 
            long-running rendering task to handle high-priority tasks, such as user input, without blocking the main thread


5) What is reconciliation in React?
            Reconciliation is React’s process of comparing the previous Virtual DOM tree with the new Virtual DOM tree 
            to determine the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM.


6) Explain React Fiber architecture?
            React Fiber is a complete re-implementation of React's core reconciliation algorithm, introduced in React 16 
            to improve performance, particularly for animation, layout, and user interactions 


7) What is lifting state up?
            Moving shared state to the closest common parent so multiple components can access and modify it.
            

8) Difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?
            The fundamental difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect is timing: 
            useEffect runs asynchronously after the browser has painted the screen, 
            while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. 


9) What is purpose of hydration?
            Hydration is simply the process of attaching JavaScript behavior to HTML elements that have been generated 
      on the server.


10) Synthetic Events in ReactJS
            Synthetic events in React are cross-browser wrappers around the browser's original event.
            It is designed to provide a consistent, cross-browser interface for handling events in React applications.


11) App UI freezes during heavy computation in reactjs?
            UI freezes in React are typically caused by heavy, synchronous computations blocking the browser's main thread.
            To prevent this, you should offload the heavy work to a separate thread using a Web Worker or use React's 
            built-in performance optimization techniques like useTransition and memoization. 


12) What is Optmistic UI Updates?
            Optimistic UI updates are a design pattern where the user interface (UI) is updated immediately after
            a user action, assuming the server operation will succeed, rather than waiting for the server's response.


13) What is the use of useTransition hook in React?
            The useTransition hook is included in React 18 to tackle this situation. 
            With this hook, you can specify any state updates as non-urgent. '      
            These non-urgent state updates will occur simultaneously with other urgent state updates, 
            but the component rendering will not wait for the non-urgent state updates.


14) Atomic Design in React:
            Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down user interfaces
            into their fundamental building blocks. This pattern provides a structured,
            hierarchical way to organize components, enhancing reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
            1. Atoms:
                  Atoms are the smallest, indivisible building blocks of a UI, often corresponding to single HTML elements or simple React components
                  Examples: Buttons, input fields, labels, icons, color palettes, and fonts.
            2. Molecules:
                  Molecules are simple combinations of atoms that function as a unit. 
                  Examples: A search bar (input and button) or a form field (label and input)
            3. Organisms:
                  Organisms are more complex components made up of molecules and atoms. 
                  Examples: A navigation bar (logo, search bar, links) or a login form.
            4. Templates:
                  Templates define the layout and structure of pages using organisms. 
                  They represent the content structure without the final content.
                  Examples: HomePageTemplate
            5. Pages:
                  Pages are specific instances of templates where real content is added. 
                  This final stage allows for testing the design system with actual data.
                  Examples: HomePage

Atmoic Design Structure Example:
src/
|-- components/
|   |-- atoms/
|   |   |-- Button.js
|   |   ...
|   |-- molecules/
|   |   |-- SearchBar.js
|   |   ...
|   |-- organisms/
|   |   |-- Header.js
|   |   ...
|   |-- templates/
|   |   |-- HomepageTemplate.js
|   |   ...
|-- pages/
|   |-- HomePage.js
|   ...

            PROS:
                  Prevents duplication when many features share UI patterns
                  Atoms and molecules are easy to unit test
                  Encourages reuse of the same base components everywhere
                  Forces you to think in terms of “building blocks”
            CONS:
                  Small or medium projects may not need this much structure
                  Atomic Design organizes by UI type, not business capability


15) React 19 Issue?
            The most significant recent issues in React 19 are a set of critical security vulnerabilities (CVEs)
            in React Server Components and various migration difficulties/breaking changes related to API removals
            and peer dependency mismatches
      A)What Exactly Happened ?
            React 19 introduced a new system for React Server Components (RSC). 
            This system sends special data streams from the server to the browser. 
            This data describes how to build the UI.
            Hackers discovered that: They could inject malicious commands into this stream.
