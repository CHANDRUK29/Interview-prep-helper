1) What are Micro FrontEnd?
      Micro frontends (MFEs) is a web development architecture where a large frontend application is broken down into smaller,
      independent, and deployable modules, each responsible for a specific business feature, allowing different teams to build,
      test, and deploy them autonomously, often using different technologies, mirroring the microservices approach for the backend

2) What Is Webpack Module Federation?
      Webpack Module Federation (introduced in Webpack 5) allows multiple independent JavaScript applications to share code at runtime.
      With Module Federation (the new world):
            *)Apps are independent
            *)They talk to each other at runtime
            *)Shared dependencies (like React) are not duplicated
            *)Each app can be deployed on its own
      Core Concepts of Webpack module Federation:
            1)Host (Shell / Container):
                  The main app
                  Loads remote applications
                  Decides when and where to render them
            2)Remote:
                  A separate app
                  Exposes modules (components, utilities, pages)
                  Built & deployed independently
            3)Exposes:
                  What a remote app makes available to others.
                  (eg)exposes: {
                                "./Cart": "./src/Cart"
                              }
            4)Shared:
                  Dependencies shared across apps (e.g. React).
                  (EG) shared: {
                                      react: { singleton: true },
                                    "react-dom": { singleton: true }
                              }
