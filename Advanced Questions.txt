1) What are Micro FrontEnd?
      Micro frontends (MFEs) is a web development architecture where a large frontend application is broken down into smaller,
      independent, and deployable modules, each responsible for a specific business feature, allowing different teams to build,
      test, and deploy them autonomously, often using different technologies, mirroring the microservices approach for the backend

2) What Is Webpack Module Federation?
      Webpack Module Federation (introduced in Webpack 5) allows multiple independent JavaScript applications to share code at runtime.
      With Module Federation (the new world):
            *)Apps are independent
            *)They talk to each other at runtime
            *)Shared dependencies (like React) are not duplicated
            *)Each app can be deployed on its own
      Core Concepts of Webpack module Federation:
            *)Host: The application currently running in the browser that consumes modules from another application.
            *)Remote: A separate application that exposes modules (components, functions, etc.) for the Host to consume.
            *)Exposed Module: A specific file or component made available by a Remote to be used by other applications.
            *)Shared Module: A dependency (like React or Vue) that is shared across applications to avoid code duplication.
            *)Runtime: Code is loaded while the application is running in the user's browser, not during the build process. 


3) What is Redux Toolkit Query(RTK)?
            RTK Query is an advanced data fetching and caching tool, designed to simplify common cases for loading data in 
            a web application


4) What is concurrent Rendering?
            Concurrent rendering in React is a foundational update introduced in React 18 that allows React to interrupt a 
            long-running rendering task to handle high-priority tasks, such as user input, without blocking the main thread


5) What is reconciliation in React?
            Reconciliation is React’s process of comparing the previous Virtual DOM tree with the new Virtual DOM tree 
            to determine the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM.


6) Explain React Fiber architecture?
            React Fiber is a complete re-implementation of React's core reconciliation algorithm, introduced in React 16 
            to improve performance, particularly for animation, layout, and user interactions 


7) What is lifting state up?
            Moving shared state to the closest common parent so multiple components can access and modify it.
            

8) Difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?
            The fundamental difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect is timing: 
            useEffect runs asynchronously after the browser has painted the screen, 
            while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints.
